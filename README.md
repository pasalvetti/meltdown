# Meltdown
_A part heating mod for Kerbal Space Program 2_

Meltdown adds the heat dimension to KSP2. Parts that consume or produce electricity heat up if they are not cooled. This is not really a problem on Kerbin where the atmosphere acts as a cooler, but it is much more difficult to diffuse heat energy in the vacuum of space. A part that exceeds its temperature limit explodes.
The player must therefore carefully plan his missions by balancing his energy needs with the heat constraints.

This mod is largely based on existing and previously unactivated stock code.

*Features*
- Crewed pods and probes generates heat by consuming electric charge.
- Fuel cells, generators, engines and solar panels generates heat by producing electric charge.
- Radiators dissipates heat but consumes a small amount of electric charge.
- The dissipative power of radiators is distributed among all vessel parts generating heat in proportion to the amount of heat they produce.
- Atmospheres affect temperature.
- A part that is no longer subjected to any energy sees its temperature getting closer to that of its environment.
- Adds six radiators.
- The consumption rate of heatshields is increased.

## Gallery

This mod adds six radiators, of varying power and shape, to meet all your mission needs.

## Known Issues
- All radiators of the same type turn on and off at the same time.
- Radiators cannot be painted.
- Probably not a Meltdown bug, but timewarp above x1000 can create instability in the EC flow, resulting in the temporary shutdown of the radiators, which can lead to overheating parts being destroyed.

## Installation
1. Open the game folder by right-clicking on the game in your Steam library, selecting "Manage," and then clicking "Browse local files."
